# Prediction of diabetes - Type 2 (Mellitus)
This is a machine learning project based on the prediction of type 2 diabetes,with a given data.It uses logistic regression to classify the diabetic outcomes of each people's record.The diabetes is threatening a lot of people nowadays, without having a perfect cure for it.There are actually two types of diabetes,namely
  - Type 1
  - Type 2

The type 2 diabetes is commonly called as diabetes mellitus.It can be defined as a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose).We consider the mellitus here.After deep researches we found that, that some parameters are directly responsible to for the mellitus to occur.By using the data of the people with and without diabetes,a dataset has been build.We use that dataset to classify the people who are in the risk of getting diabetes.
